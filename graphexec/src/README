* Program purpose
This program executes a set of shell commands according to a specified order given in an input text file.

* How to compile the program
Before compiling the program in command line, first put the source file and makefile in the same directory.

To compile the program

make

To clean up the directory

make clean

* How to use the program from the shell
Before using the program, please make sure all related files are in the same directory.

The excutable takes the master input file as the only one argument. It will echo related information on stdout as it is being excuted.

./graphexec some-text-file.txt

* What exactly your program does
This program builds up a graph that specifies the excution order according to the master input file. Each node in the graph corresponds to a line in the master input file and has associated redirected input and output file names.

In the excution procedure, we linearly search all the nodes. Any node is in one of the following status: READY, RUNNING, FINISHED and INELIGIBLE.

- When a child is running, which is determined by using waitpid with WNOHANG. That function tells IMMEDIATELY if a child (node) is still running or has existed.

-	When a child finishes excution, we updates all its child nodes.

-	When a child is ready, we excute the child. In this process, we implemeted a executeChild function. It firstly redirects the output and input using dup2 and then executes the given commands. Proper error message will be displayed if a child fails to execute.

-	When a child is ineligible, we proceed to next node.

The overall interation ends when the number of executed nodes reaches the total number of nodes in the graph.

In addition, a helper function makeargv is used. It parses a string into tokens according to a given delimiter. This function is used repeatedly. We use the sample code from R&R textbook page 37, Chap. 2.
