Following are the instructions to run the sample 'browser' executable:
1. Load the 'webkit' module via 'module load soft/webkit'.  This may not be required on KH 4250 or 1260 machines.
2. Set up the X-server.
	a) Mechanism to set-up X server varies depending on the operating system
	   from which you SSH into the CSELABS machine. 
		i) Ubuntu (or other flavors of Unix): No need for any X-server setup.
		   You can skip this step.
		ii) Windows: Download and install 'xming' (http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/).
		   Then RUN the 'xming' prior to connecting the CSELABS machine where you
		   intend to run the sample code.
3. Enable X11 forwarding
  	SSH on CSELABS machine enabling the X forwarding: If you are using command-line 
	tool to SSH, then X11 forwarding can be enabled by specifying -X option. For
	example, ssh -X username@machine.cselabs.umn.edu would enable X11 forwarding.
	   
	If however you are using Putty to ssh, X11 forwarding can be enabled by 
	clicking and following 'Connection->SSH->X11' tab in the 'Category' Panel
 	of Putty. Then check-mark to enable X11 forwarding on the 'Options 
 	controlling SSH X11 forwarding' window.
	 
4. Execute 'browser' binary: Now you are ready to run the 'browser' binary. Running
   it would open the browser window. Follow the assignment description thereafter
   to run the browser.

NOTE: Specified URL in the CONTROLLER window MUST begin with 'http://'.
