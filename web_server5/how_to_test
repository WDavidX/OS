RUNNING THE WEB SERVER
============================================================
Extract "testing.tar" and use it as your webserver root
directory. Run your webserver using the following command

./web_server <port> <path_to_testing>/testing <num_dispatch> <num_worker> <queue_len>

For example, to run the web server at port 9000, with root directory "/home/student/joe/testing" with 100 dispatch and worker threads,
queue length 100 run the following command

./web_server 9000 /home/student/joe/testing 100 100 100

Open another terminal and issue the following command,

wget -i <path-to-urls>/urls -O results 

In our case we should run
wget -i /home/student/joe/testing/urls -O myres

The above command will ask wget to fetch all the URLs listed
on the file named "urls" that you downloaded from the assignment page.
